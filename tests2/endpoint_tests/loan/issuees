1) record 2 should show that interest is added to the outstanding one dollar, closing_balance seems wrong
2) no more records are generated after

record 4, 2015-07-01 is closing date of 14-15 period?





how to make the code accept an overpayment?


is it the case that at least one payment is expected / assumed, each year? That'd explain why a 7-year-termed loan is cut off after ~7 records maybe?
