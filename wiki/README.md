## Robust docs
You can read the documentation right here, by clicking [docs](docs).

## maintenance & development

### init
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.10 venv; . venv/bin/activate.fish; pip install -r requirements.txt

### useful commands

``` mkdocs serve ```

``` mkdocs build ```

### future
media should probably be moved to a separate repo, probably reusing https://github.com/koo5/accounts-assessor-public-wiki/ , where there are already big screenshots there.


CI should use something like: https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/603e637308567f453a16
