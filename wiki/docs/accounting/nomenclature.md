from https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-a-journal-entry.html:
"""The structural rules of a journal entry are that there must be a minimum of two line items in the journal entry, and that the total amount you enter in the debit column equals the total amount entered in the credit column."""

"""A compound journal entry is an accounting entry in which there is more than one debit, more than one credit, or more than one of both debits and credits. It is essentially a combination of several simple journal entries;"""

Well, thats confusing. Better resources are welcome. Meanwhile, i am proposing this nomenclature, to be introduced on an occasion of a rewrite or similar:

A "Line": our current transaction() term. It only afects one account.
An "Entry": a list of lines. Arbitrarily many accounts involved.
a bst() term: current s_transaction, that is, statement transaction, that is, bank statement transaction
