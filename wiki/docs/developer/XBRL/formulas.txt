 The concept core dimension MUST be present on all facts (oime:missingConceptDimension).

The concept core dimension MUST identify a concept from the taxonomy (oime:unknownConcept). 





    The concept identified as the source of the relationship is referred to as the total concept.
    The concept identified as the target of the relationship is referred to as a contributing concept.
    The value of the defining arc's weight attribute is referred to as the contribution weight.




A calculation binds wherever the following conditions are met:

    A reported data point T, exists with a concept core dimension of the calculation's total concept;
    The set of contributing reported data points, SS, consisting of reported data points which have a concept core dimension of any of the calculations's contributing concepts and which are dimensionally aligned to T is not empty.








The fact value interval for a fact is the range of possible values that the reported fact value is consistent with having been rounded from, allowing for a "half" value to have been rounded either up or down. For a fact with {value} v, and finite {decimals} property d, it is defined as:

[v-0.5*10^(0-d), v+0.5*10^(0-d)]

For a fact with a {decimals} property of "infinity", it is defined as the single point interval:

[v, v]

For example, a fact with a value of 5,000 and decimals = -3 represents an interval of:

  [5000 - 0.5 * 10^3, 5000 + 0.5 * 10^3] 
= [5000 - 500, 5000 + 500]
= [4500, 5500]







4.5â€€Interval arithmetic

The process described above requires two interval arithmetic operations: multiplication and addition.

Addition of two intervals, is defined as:

[x1, x2] + [y1, y2] = [x1 + y1, x2 + y2]
