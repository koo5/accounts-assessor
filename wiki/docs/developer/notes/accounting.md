The pacioli paper and "An algebraic model for the representation of accounting systems" essentially describes our basic accounts / transactions / vectors structures and operations, it would be a useful resource if we ever decided to go for a formalization of our system in a proof assistant. The latter also deals with imposing some constraints on transactions and balances to aid detecting incorrect transactions.
