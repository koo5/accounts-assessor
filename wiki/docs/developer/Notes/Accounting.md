## accounting for developers

the accounting equation is maybe better expressed as "(magnitude of) assets = (magnitude of) debt to owner (equity; owner is the creditor) + (magnitude of) debt to others (liabilities; other creditors)"

so, the accounting equation would really be "the amount the company owes (debit) = the amount that has been credited to it (credits, from the perspective of the creditors)" and the subdivision of the RHS is by creditor, which is one way to subdivide assets by "role"

The pacioli paper and "An algebraic model for the representation of accounting systems" essentially describes our basic accounts / transactions / vectors structures and operations, it would be a useful resource if we ever decided to go for a formalization of our system in a proof assistant. The latter also deals with imposing some constraints on transactions and balances to aid detecting incorrect transactions.
