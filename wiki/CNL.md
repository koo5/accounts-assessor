> To support automatic reasoning in ACE, we have developed the Attempto
Reasoner (RACE). RACE can prove that one ACE text is the logical consequence
of another one, and give a justification for the success or the failure of the proof
in ACE.

> AceRules is a forward
chaining rule system that offers three different semantics.
