example interaction:

>> curl -L -S --fail --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"type":"residency","current_state":[]}' http://localhost:7788/chat
{"result":{"question":"Do you live in Australia?","state":[{"question_id":1,"response":-1}]}}‚èé

/*
 The original nomenclature is by now a bit confusing.
"state" is a list of {question_id, response} objects, would be better called history.
"question id" is the state of the FSM.
*/

/*TODO: 
revive tests, add more tests

sbe question ids start at 0, residency at 1, change sbe

in case of complete failure, alternative framework: https://www.d3web.de/Wiki.jsp?page=Bike%20Diagnosis
