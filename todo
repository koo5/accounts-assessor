#ifdef DEV for localhost servers




livestock standalone needs frontend server support for requesting xml result



failing because of a bug in calling arelle:
        ['endpoint_tests/ledger/ledger--with-schemaref']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
        ['endpoint_tests/ledger/historical_vs_current1']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
move arelle into python_server.
   


	reset_gensym(iri), % because we use gensym in investment reports and it will keep incrementing
	throughout the test-cases, causing fresh responses to not match saved responses.


/*
todo:
debug
    This option enables or disables the possibility to debug the CHR code. Possible values are on (default) and off. See section 9.4 for more details on debugging. The default is derived from the Prolog flag generate_debug_info, which is true by default. See -nodebug. If debugging is enabled, optimization must be disabled.
generate_debug_info(bool, changeable)
    If true (default) generate code that can be debugged using trace/0, spy/1, etc. Can be set to false using the -nodebug. This flag is scoped within a source file. Many of the libraries have :- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false) to hide their details from a normal trace.20
swipl --nodebug
anyway, :- set_prolog_flag(generate_debug_info, false)
    --pldoc[=port]           Start PlDoc server [at port]
    --home=DIR               Use DIR as SWI-Prolog home
    --dump-runtime-variables[=format]
                        Dump link info in sh(1) format
editor(atom, changeable)
    Determines the editor used by edit/1. See section 4.4.1 for details on selecting the editor used.
backtrace_goal_depth(integer, changeable)
    The frame of a backtrace is printed after making a shallow copy of the goal. This flag determines the depth to which the goal term is copied. Default is `3'.
xref(bool, changeable)
    If true, source code is being read for analysis purposes such as cross-referencing. Otherwise (default) it is being read to be compiled. This flag is used at several places by term_expansion/2 and goal_expansion/2 hooks, notably if these hooks use side effects. See also the libraries library(prolog_source) and library(prolog_xref).

testcases - client_version is "test_runner" - endpoint will allow that.










split out internal_workers modules used by frontend_server
secrets
ports - internally, bind to some new ports, like 6666, to make it less confusing
docker confiigurations - django dev vs prod
RabbitMQ contains functionality which explicitly tracks and manages memory usage, and thus needs to be made aware of cgroup-imposed limits.

# security issues:
# internal_services is a HTTP django RPC server that handles some OS interaction and other tasks like XML validation for prolog. This includes executing arbitrary shell commands.  If an attacker can make our code invoke http requests to arbitrary URLs, they get shell access. There is no authentication. And against standards, it invokes actions on GET requests, but that is just a convenience and can be disabled for production, and disabling that is probably all we need to do.
# invoking http GET requests to arbitrary URLs is possible through:
#  arelle, by referencing them in xbrl files referenced by users
#  fetch_file_from_url, used for fetching additional input files specified by user


# calls to load_xml from prolog: opening arbitrary files


# todo: docker secrets, docker configs, try to keep sensitive info in files..
