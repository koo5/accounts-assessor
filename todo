livestock standalone needs frontend server support for requesting xml result



failing because of a bug in calling arelle:
        ['endpoint_tests/ledger/ledger--with-schemaref']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
        ['endpoint_tests/ledger/historical_vs_current1']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
move arelle into python_server.
   


	reset_gensym(iri), % because we use gensym in investment reports and it will keep incrementing
	throughout the test-cases, causing fresh responses to not match saved responses.
