xml_write does add_missing_namespaces. 
When i finish checking current round of modifications against saved response files, i'll rewrite the response files with the output with this predicate un-commented.


failing because of a bug in calling arelle:
	['endpoint_tests/ledger/ledger--with-schemaref']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
	['endpoint_tests/ledger/historical_vs_current1']): testcase_error(http_code_400)
move arelle into python_server.
