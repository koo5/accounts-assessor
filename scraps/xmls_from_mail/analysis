<unit> signifies unit count. 

When there is both <unit> and <unitType>:
        exchanged account is debited with the given count of the given unit type

If there is only <unitType>:
        exchanged account is debited with number of units given by conversion rate at the transaction date

only <unit> would presumably be an invalid input.

If there is neither:
        exchanged account is debited/credited with an inverse amount of the same currency



in the wrapper:
When there is both <unit> and <unitType>:
	vector(unitType, unit, 0) is constructed and bases are set to null. 

If there is only <unitType>:
	vector is null and bases = [unitType]. 

If there is neither:
	vector is null and bases is defaultUnitTypes/unitType.




preprocess_s_transactions is called on the list of transactions, 

then balance_sheet_at
