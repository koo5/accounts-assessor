dimensional analysis notes:

		* Closing_Unit_Price_Foreign : Foreign/Unit
			* Foreign^1 * Unit^-1
			* {
				"foreign": 1,
				"unit": -1
			  }
			* semantic_thing(..)
		* Closing_Currency_Conversion : Report/Foreign
			* exchange_rate(Report/Foreign)
		* Closing_Unit_Price_Converted : Report/Unit
			
		m/s
		m^2

		5m + 10m
		m + m  <-- pure dimensional arithmetic
		5m * 10m <-- vs. quantity arithmetic
		m*m = m^2 = Area
		5m * 2s 
		5m / 2s 
		5m + 2s <-- nope
		5minutes + 2seconds ? <-- yep, because they're both just units of time dimension
		5apples + 4 oranges ? <-- maybe?
			* if there's a common conversion into some dimension?
			* ex. you have 9 fruits..

		dimensions: ex time, mass, length				
		units: ex. minutes, kilograms, feet				<--
		quantities: 5 minutes, 10 kilograms, 8 feet		<-- these two levels well worked out in the Python

		Given:
		60 seconds / minute
		60 minutes / hour
		24 hours / day

		How many seconds in a day...
		
		There are also explicitly dimensionless quantities...
		* haven't had to actually deal w/ this yet
		
		(Count : Unit) * (Price : Currency/Unit) = (Price * Count) : Currency

		Can read the units directly out of the quantity for reporting purposes and potentially for automatically figuring out calculations
			like w/ the seconds -> days conversion, etc...
	

		r1: market value today
		r2: contract rate
		r3: market value at contract maturity

		r1 USD/AUD today


		in the future:
		contract rate: r2 USD/AUD

		but the market value in the future might be r3

		r2 vs r3 is "the spread" <-- definitely a factor in gains
		but i'm not sure about r1

		r4 : virtual rate computed from the price gotten at selling the contract(?)
