## ports
Ports 80 and 443 have to be open to make caddy and SSL work. Internally, you can also make use of port 88 (direct to apache), which is without authentication or SSL.

Note that docker overrides your firewall rules, see: https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker . It open ports declared in the `ports:` section in docker-stack yaml. Note that the real docker-stack yaml file is generated by `deploy.sh` from `docker-stack-template.yml`, and publishes either 443+80 or 88(insecure).
